SkyFot
======

This is a repositoty to store source code for Sky Photo idea!

This idea is to let us to take photo(s) to sky and upload the picture in a central website! 
This is from my thought today: when we stay golden gate nearby, cissy field, or ??? green, it was cloudy, and so silly,
but we back to 101/280, it is sunny and warmer. I always want to know it is becoming sunny here and there, 
or only here is sunny but there is cloudy still.

Maybe it is funny, and I want to implement it with the mobile apps.
Cheer!
